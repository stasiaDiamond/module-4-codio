# Module 4 Activities

MITxPro Codio activities for Week 5/Module 4. I've added loads of my own comments to help teach myself what each line of code is doing. I've also added a space after each activity to discuss any challenges faced during execution.

The curriculum doesn't provide sufficient information or resources for learning, so I'm making the most out of what is given and expanding on it in my own words.

My intention is to use the curriculum's ambiguity to further deepen my knowledge of how to piece apart an assignment with minimal guidance.

This additional work has helped me. Perhaps I can help others

## Spot Something Wrong?

Feel free to reach out if you spot something I did incorrectly. I love to learn and grow!
